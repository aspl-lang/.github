<br>Enjoy modern features like object-oriented-programming, garbage collection and multithreading, deploy single file apps with no dependencies and use the large standard library instead of always reinventing the wheel.
<br>The source code, examples, an introduction to the language, and more are available in the <a href="https://github.com/ASPLGithub/ASPL">ASPL monorepo</a>.
